omen_overseer,SHIP,"""Designated 'Overseer', this overhauled Omen has revolutionized its role. By refitting the pilot's suite to operate as a fleet operations suite and replacing previous subsystems with the best available, the Overseer has expanded its support role of the base chassis to the fit the needs of admirals who lead from the front through the storm of battle.""",,,
omen_overlord,SHIP,"""Previously an Omen, the Overlord sacrificed both rear weapon mounts and EMP emitter capability for two flight decks. With added hull being dedicated to standard carrier functions and to a point-defense drone system (with the removal of the EMP emitter, it is not uncommon for captains to quietly state it as the only point-defense capability on-board), improvements for pilot space were minimal, thus recovery shuttles were an added function of the drone bay after combat. As a result there is a noticeable jump in overall maintenance.""",,,
